                                  <p>“Find out what you like doing best, and get someone to pay you for doing it.” – Katharine Whitehorn. This is a quote that I live and breathe by each and every day of my life. Finding what I like doing best is my ultimate goal in life. To achieve that, I have some smaller goals as well. I want to be able to explore three careers in my life to understand what I truly want. How will I do that? By exposing myself to different topics, clubs, and events so I can immerse myself in the real world and gain a clear view of my true passions.</p>

                                  <p>Recently, I have realized that combining my interests in computer science, engineering, and the medical field is the path for me because I enjoy helping people, learning about the body, and solving complex problems. The integration of technology and medicine presents exciting challenges and opportunities, and I am eager to be part of this innovative field.</p>

                                  <p>In addition to my passion for the medical field, I have a strong interest in computer science and engineering. Combining my love for helping people with my fascination for technology will allow me to make a meaningful impact in the lives of athletes through sports medicine. My goal is to pursue a career as a sports medicine physician, incorporating advanced technology to enhance diagnosis and treatment of sports-related injuries. I envision using my skills in computer science and engineering to develop innovative tools and methods that improve patient outcomes and advance the field. My experiences that align with this include playing football in high school, writing a research project on sports medicine, learning programming, and going through an injury myself.</p>

                                  <p>Some of my major accomplishments in high school include being selected for the football team, receiving academic awards for outstanding performance, volunteering at a local sports clinic where I assisted in rehabilitation exercises for injured athletes, and completing courses in computer science and engineering. These experiences have strengthened my passion for sports medicine and shown me the importance of teamwork, dedication, and continuous learning to succeed in this field. In the future, I plan to pursue a degree related to sports medicine, computer science, or biomedical engineering to further enhance my knowledge and skills. I also aim to gain practical experience through internships and shadowing opportunities with experienced sports medicine professionals. Ultimately, my goal is to make a positive impact on the lives of athletes by providing them
