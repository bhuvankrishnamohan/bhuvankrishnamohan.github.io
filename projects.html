We worked together and faced challenges with planning and time but through hard, focused work we got it done. I learned a lot about how to use <u>OpenAI to get a data set for our flashcards.</u></li>

The app has a admin and client panel. When admin is clicked, the admin can choose between three options, earthquake, fire, and lockdown. When one is chosen, it will alert the admin and post the message on the API. When going to the previous reports page, it will use the “get” from the API to retrieve all the previous reports, and the delete button will delete all previous reports with a password from the API. When the client is clicked, it will show the most recent report. When reporting the type of emergency, other students and teachers will be able to see what is happening. This can also be known as “post”. <u>My role in this was the developer</u>, coding all the API and backend javascript for funcionality. The difficulties were <u>getting it through the API and bypassing CORS Blocker</u>. The debugging was the hardest part. I learned that there is always a way to make the code work. I just need to think in the right direction.
